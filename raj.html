                <p>
                    Once upon a younger year
When all the shadows disapear,
The animals inside, came out to play.
Went face-to-face with our fears,
Learned the lessons through the tears,
Made memories we knew would never fade.
One day, my father he told me:
'Son, don't let it slip away'
He took me in his arms, I heard him sing:
'When you get older, you wild heart will look for younger days,
think of me if ever you're afraid'
He said: 'One day you'll leave this world behind,
so live a life you will remember'
My father told me when I was just a child:
'These are the nights that never die!'
My father told me...
One thunder clashed and flown down,
light a fire they can't put out,
carve your name in to the shiny stars
He said: 'Go venture far beyond the shores,
don't forsake this life of yours,
I'll guide you home no matter where you are.'
'Son, don't let it slip away'
He took me in his arms, i heard him sing:
'When you get older, you wild heart will look for younger days,
think of me if ever you're afraid'
